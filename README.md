## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Running the Game

The memory game can be run on any internet browser (Google Chrome Recommended).

## How to Play

1. Flip each card by clicking on each square. The purpose of the game is to match one card with its equal counterpart.

3. There is not time limit to the game.

4. Star rating is giving based on the number of moved it required to complete the game. 5 stars is the maximum score and it is awarded when the least possible amount of moves is used. 

5. Game is finished/won when all 8 pairs are matched/found.

6. A new game can be reset/started by clicking on the re-start icon next to the star ratings.
